# XSS-Shigeno

## Presentation
A tool for detecting a potential XSS on a page. It's just the beginning of it, I'm planning to add more and more features.
For the moment, it allows to detect input texts and run a lot of xss payloads in it until a dialog box appears.

## Usage
- `node node_modules/puppeteer/install.js`
